    Logic Behind the clock:
    for HOUR HAND : 
    1 hour = 360 / 12 = 30 degrees
    => that means for h hour angle will be 30h degrees.
    but when time is 08:30 or something else we want our hour hand between two numbers like in this case we neet between 8 and 9,
    because there will be rotation of few angles due to minute and second hand;
    then,
    60 minutes = 30 degrees rotation
    1 minute = 1/2 degrees rotation
    => m minutes = (m / 2) degrees rotation
    Thus, total rotation for h hour = (30h + m/2) ....I formula 
    (Second hand's rotation is counted as negligible)

    for MINUTE HAND : 
    60 min = 360 degrees
    1 min = 360 / 60 = 6 degrees
    => m minutes = 6m degrees
    (Second hand's rotation is counted as negligible)

    for SECOND HAND : 
    60 seconds = 360 degrees
    1 second = 6 degrees
    => s seconds = 6s degrees
